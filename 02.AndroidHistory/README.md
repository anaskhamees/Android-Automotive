#  Android Operating System

## 1. Android OS

Android is an open-source operating system developed by Google, primarily designed for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. However, it has expanded to various other platforms, including TVs, wearable devices, and automotive systems. Android’s flexibility, scalability, and customization options make it a popular choice in the embedded systems and automotive industries.

The **Android kernel** is based on the **Linux kernel**. The Android operating system leverages the Linux kernel as its core component, handling the low-level tasks such as **hardware abstraction**, **process management**, **memory management**, **device drivers**, and **networking**. While Android uses the Linux kernel, the rest of the Android OS—such as the application framework, libraries, and runtime—is designed specifically for mobile devices, providing a rich set of APIs and tools for app development.
