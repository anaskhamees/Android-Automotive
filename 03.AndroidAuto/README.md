# Android Auto
### 1. What is Android Auto

Android Auto is a platform that connects an Android-powered smartphone to a vehicle’s **In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI)** system, enabling a driver-friendly interface for apps such as navigation, media, and communication. It allows users to interact with their phone’s apps using the car's touchscreen, buttons, or voice commands while maintaining focus on the road.

To use Android Auto, an Android device with **Android 6.0** (or above) is required. **Android 10** and later come with Android Auto pre-installed, while older versions require installing the Android Auto app. It works through both wired (USB) and wireless (Wi-Fi) connections to the car’s head unit.

**Android Auto provides:**

- **Simplified Interface:** A UI optimized for quick access and minimal distraction.
- **Voice Interaction:** Google Assistant handles navigation, messages, and calls.
- **App Access:** Apps like Google Maps, Spotify, and messaging platforms are supported.
- **Cross-Device Support:** Works with various car models and phones.

The **Android Auto application** is not a standalone application but rather an extension of an existing regular Android application designed to be compatible with **Android Auto**, **Android Developers** build a specific module or functionality within their app that integrates with Android Auto.

If you have a music app like **Spotify**, the Android Auto integration allows Spotify (Regular Android App) to display a simplified interface with basic controls (play, pause, skip, etc.) on your car's infotainment screen while driving.

### 3. How Android Auto Work

Android Auto enables communication between an **Android device** and the **car's head unit** (**IVI**). The primary purpose of Android Auto is to make the Android device compatible with the car's infotainment system, creating a seamless user experience for functions such as media playback, navigation, and messaging.

 #### 3.1. Android Auto Protocol

Android Auto uses a specialized protocol called the **Android Auto Protocol**, which is built on top of the **Android Open Accessory (AOA) protocol**. This protocol ensures communication between the mobile device (Android phone) and the car's head unit (IVI system) using multiple communication channels.

- **Transport Agnostic**: The protocol supports both **wired** (via USB) and **wireless** (via Wi-Fi) communication between the devices.
- **C++ Library**: Google provides a C++ library that car manufacturers integrate into their head units to support the Android Auto Protocol. This allows Android Auto to work on various car platforms like **Linux**, **Android**, and **QNX** (used by some manufacturers like BMW and Audi).

#### 3.2. Communication Channels between Android Device (Mobile) and Car IVI

![image-20241223003227580](README.assets/image-20241223003227580.png)

Android Auto divides the communication into **four main channels** for efficient and prioritized data exchange between the Android device and the car's head unit:

- **Audio Channel**: For streaming audio, such as media or calls, from the Android device to the car’s head unit. This channel supports **bidirectional** communication for features like **hands-free calling** and **Google Assistant** integration.
- **Display Channel**: Responsible for displaying the user interface (UI) from the Android device onto the car's screen. The data flow is **unidirectional** — from the Android device to the head unit.
- **Input Channel**: Allows user input (via the car’s touch screen, buttons, or knobs) to be transmitted from the car's head unit to the Android device. This enables interaction with Android Auto apps, such as selecting a song or navigating to a destination.
- **Sensor Channel**: Transfers sensor data from the car to the Android device, such as GPS coordinates, speed, and other telemetry data that the Android Auto app might need.

All data between the two devices is formatted using **Protocol Buffers**, which ensure efficient serialization and deserialization of data for transmission over these channels.

>**Protocol Buffers (protobuf)** is a language-agnostic, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism developed by Google for serializing structured data. It is widely used for communication between different systems, particularly in environments where performance and efficiency are critical.
>
>Provide a robust solution for efficient data serialization and communication between systems. Its compact binary format and language-agnostic nature make it ideal for modern distributed systems, APIs, and storage, offering advantages over traditional formats like JSON and XML.

#### 3.3. The Process of Connection Between Mobile and Car (via Android Auto)

**3.3.1. Establishing Connection (Step 1)**

When an Android device is connected to the car's head unit, whether via USB (wired) or Wi-Fi (wireless), the first step is **authentication and identification** between the two devices using the **Android Auto Protocol**.

- **USB Mode**: In the case of a wired connection, the Android device is recognized as a **USB accessory**, and the car's head unit acts as the **host**.
- **Wireless Mode**: If the connection is wireless, the Android device and car's head unit communicate over Wi-Fi, but the Android Auto Protocol still governs the data exchange.

Once the connection is established, the **Car Session** is activated. This session allows the **Android Auto app** on the device to interact with the head unit.

**3.3.2. Displaying the Home Screen on the Car Display (Step 2)**

Once the Android Auto session is established, the Android device sends the **home screen UI** to the car’s head unit via the **Display channel**. This serves as the **starting point** for the Android Auto experience.

**3.3.3. Interacting with Android Auto Apps (Step 3)**

When the user taps on an app icon on the car’s screen (e.g., a media app like Spotify):

- **Input Event**: A touch event (including X and Y coordinates) is sent from the car’s head unit to the Android device through the **Input channel**.
- **App Activation**: The Android device processes this event, starts the selected app, and prepares the UI for display on the head unit.
- **Display Channel**: The app's UI is streamed back to the car's head unit using the **Display channel**.

**3.3.4. Playing Media (Step 4)**

If the user selects a song to play, the process involves multiple communication channels:

- **Input Channel**: The touch event to select the song is transmitted from the car's head unit to the Android device (Mobile).
- **App Processing**: The song is downloaded, processed, and prepared on the Android device.
- **Display Channel**: The "Now Playing" UI is sent back to the car's head unit to show the current track and controls.
- **Audio Channel**: The audio data for the selected song is streamed from the Android device to the car's head unit for playback.

#### 3.4. Car Head Unit  (IVI) Side

The car's **head unit** serves as a display to project the Android Auto app running on the phone. The head unit doesn't run the Android Auto app itself—it acts as a **receiver** and relies on a software stack to handle communication with the phone. The car head unit identifies the Android device and starts using the **Android Auto Protocol (AAP)** for communication.
